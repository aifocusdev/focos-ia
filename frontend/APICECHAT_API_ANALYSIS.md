# ApiCeChat API - Comprehensive System Analysis (Updated 2025)

## Executive Summary

ApiCeChat is a sophisticated multi-tenant chat/CRM system built on NestJS 11 that integrates with WhatsApp Business API via Meta's Graph API. The system provides real-time messaging capabilities, contact management, conversation routing, file attachments, and role-based access control. It's designed to handle customer service operations with support for human agents, automated bots, and comprehensive conversation lifecycle management with advanced WebSocket functionality.

### Key Business Rules & Constraints

1. **Conversation Assignment**: A conversation can only be assigned to either a user OR a bot, never both (enforced by database constraint)
2. **Message Sender Validation**: Messages from users must have sender_user set, messages from bots must have sender_bot set (enforced by database check constraint)
3. **Contact Uniqueness**: Contacts are uniquely identified by external_id (WhatsApp ID) and phone_number (separate unique constraints)
4. **Role-based Access**: Admin role required for most contact management and configuration operations
5. **WhatsApp Integration**: Access tokens are encrypted and excluded from serialization
6. **File Upload**: Comprehensive validation for file types, sizes, and metadata extraction

## Enumeration Types

### Core Enums
```typescript
ConversationStatus {
  QUEUE = 'queue',
  ACTIVE = 'active',
  CLOSED = 'closed',
  TRANSFERRED = 'transferred'
}

MessageSender {
  CONTACT = 'contact',
  USER = 'user',
  BOT = 'bot',
  SYSTEM = 'system'
}

MessageStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',
  SENT = 'sent',
  DELIVERED = 'delivered',
  READ = 'read',
  FAILED = 'failed'
}

AttachmentKind {
  IMAGE = 'image',
  AUDIO = 'audio',
  VIDEO = 'video',
  DOCUMENT = 'document'
}

UserStatus {
  ONLINE = 'online',
  AWAY = 'away',
  BUSY = 'busy',
  OFFLINE = 'offline'
}
```

### WhatsApp Specific Enums
```typescript
WhatsappMessageType {
  TEXT = 'text',
  IMAGE = 'image',
  DOCUMENT = 'document',
  AUDIO = 'audio',
  VIDEO = 'video',
  STICKER = 'sticker',
  LOCATION = 'location',

}

WebhookEventType {
  MESSAGE = 'message',
  MESSAGE_STATUS = 'message_status',
  MESSAGE_REACTION = 'message_reaction',
  MESSAGE_DELETED = 'message_deleted'
}
```

## Business Logic & Workflows

### Conversation Lifecycle (Enhanced)
1. **Creation**: New conversations created via API with contact and integration validation
2. **Assignment**: Can be assigned to human agents (users) or automated bots with mutual exclusivity enforced
3. **Auto-Assignment**: Smart assignment to current user if no specific user provided in assignment request
4. **Unread Tracking**: Real-time unread count management with automatic reset on assignment
5. **Privacy Controls**: User-based conversation visibility (own assignments + unassigned + bot conversations)
6. **Status Management**: Read/unread status tracking with WebSocket notifications
7. **Transfer**: Conversations can be transferred between agents with proper assignment validation

### Message Flow
1. **Inbound (WhatsApp → System)**:
   - Webhook receives message from Meta API with full metadata
   - Creates/updates contact if needed based on external_id
   - Creates/retrieves conversation with proper integration mapping
   - Stores message with full attachment processing
   - Emits real-time WebSocket events to connected clients
   - Triggers bot responses if conversation is bot-assigned
   - Updates conversation last_message cache

2. **Outbound (System → WhatsApp)**:
   - Message created in database with proper sender validation
   - Sent via Meta WhatsApp API with retry logic
   - Status updates tracked through webhooks (sent/delivered/read/failed)
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket to all conversation participants
   - File attachments uploaded to WhatsApp media API first

### Real-time Features (WebSocket)
- **User Presence**: Multi-connection online/offline status tracking with cleanup
- **Typing Indicators**: Auto-cleanup after 3 seconds, stale detection after 10 seconds
- **Message Delivery**: Live message updates with status progression
- **Conversation Rooms**: Join/leave conversation-specific rooms (`conversation_{id}`)
- **Notifications**: System-wide notification broadcasting
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user WebSocket throttling with automatic cleanup

- **Cache-first Strategy**: Check cache before querying database for conversation last messages
- **Automatic Cache Management**: Periodic cleanup (every 15 seconds) with cache invalidation
- **Memory-based Caching**: In-memory Map-based cache with timestamp-based expiration
- **File storage** via CDN-capable Supabase with automatic scaling
- **Real-time event caching** and cleanup
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces database queries by up to 90% for frequently accessed last messages

### Real-time Performance
- Connection pooling for WebSocket management
- Periodic cleanup of stale connections (1-minute intervals)
- Efficient room management for conversations
- Event broadcasting optimization
- Memory leak prevention with automatic cleanup
